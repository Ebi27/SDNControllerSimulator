class Controller:
    """
    A class to manage flow control and optimize energy usage in the network.

    This class represents the SDN controller responsible for optimizing communication between smart devices and switches
    to conserve energy. It defines methods for installing and updating flow rules based on predefined paths.

    Attributes:
        switches (list): A list of switches in the network.
        paths (dict): A dictionary to store predefined paths for traffic optimization.

    Methods:
        install_flow_rule(source_device, destination_device)
            Install a flow rule for communication between source and destination devices using APIs.

        update_flow_rule(source_device, destination_device)
            Update an existing flow rule based on changing network conditions using APIs.

        optimize_energy_usage()
            Optimize energy usage by prioritizing communication paths that conserve energy.
            This function implements decision-making logic to update flow rules using APIs.
